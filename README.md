VirtualRobot
============
#####Introduction

We are "Hello World!", and this is the second project of our first year studying Computer Science at Coventry University.
The criteria we built this project around is as follows:
- Set up a number of landmarks, a set of traffic lights with instructions (i.e. the red light to stop, amber to wait and a green light to go), and a number of treasures (each hidden on a different landmark). 
- Two robots, each with a random starting point and the description of a given landmark, should pick up different treasures (indicated in a form of text, image or sound when found) that are worth at least 100 points before reaching their given landmark, whilst avoiding each other, moving away from the landmarks with no treasures and following the traffic light instructions along the way until one of robots has found its treasure first. 
- Furthermore, while a robot is approaching a landmark where no treasure is hidden, the information about the landmark should be displayed on the screen, such as a web page containing information about the landmark.
- A map can be incorporated into the program as the background along with any other innovative features.

Against the project criteria, we have successfully implemented:
- A number of landmarks
- Traffic lights with three different colours
- Two robots that search for landmarks and treasure
- An emailing system which emails the user information about the treasure they've found
- Multiplayer
- Innovative features such as Virtual Reality
- A map creator and editor

This project uses:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Pygame
- The A* Searching Algorithm
- A Second Searching Algorithm, Breadth-First
- An optional Virtual Reality application which runs alongside it

"oldBase" branch contains the first project which we used as a base for future projects

#####Project Aims
- [x] Make it *work*
- [x] Make it *better*
- [x] Make it ***the best***

#####Instructions
- Download the project
- Run game.py
- If you wish to receive emails based on what landmarks you find, go into Settings and enter your name and email, and tick the "Receive Emails" tickbox
- Select which gamemode you wish to play
- - In Single Player, you must try to get the highest score possible in the allotted time by collecting treasure
- - In Multiplayer you can play against your friends to see who can get the highest score
- - In AI you can observe the AI collecting treasure
