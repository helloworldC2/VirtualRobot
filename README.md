VirtualRobot
============
#####Introduction

We are "Hello World!", and this is the third project of our first year studying Computer Science at Coventry University.
The criteria we built this project around is as follows:
- The program should allow the user to select and place different types of treasures (e.g. jewellery, coins, silverware) and a number of hidden traps (randomly generated) within an arena. 
- The program should provide a brief description for each treasure and assign each treasure with a score. 
- The program should have a starting point, time, and a wish list of treasures to find, also provided by the user, a robot should start with the nearest treasure and gather as many treasures that are required on the list as possible within the given time.
- When the robot stops at any of the treasures on the wish list, the info about that treasure should be displayed on the screen.
- Furthermore, the program should make the robot lose the last treasure it has collected when the robot falls into a hidden trap during the treasure hunt.
- The program should display the treasures that have been collected in an unsorted order, and then that robot will then show how the treasures (according to their scores in an ascending or descending order) are sorted in an animation.
- This animation should be based on a user-defined sorting algorithm.
- Any other innovative features may also be included.

Against the project criteria, we have successfully implemented:
- A number of treasures and traps
- A brief description of the treasure, with a score
- A wishlist of treasures!
- A sorting algorithm which displays the treasures the user has collected
- A leaderboard of scores which works with the end-user
- An emailing system which emails the user information about the treasure they've found
- Innovative features such as Virtual Reality
- A map creator and editor

This project uses:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Pygame
- The A* Searching Algorithm
- A Second Searching Algorithm, Breadth-First
- An optional Virtual Reality application which runs alongside it

"oldBase" branch contains the first project which we used as a base for future projects

#####Project Aims
- [x] Make it *work*
- [x] Make it *better*
- [x] Make it ***the best***

#####Instructions
- Download the project
- Run game.py
- If you wish to receive emails based on what landmarks you find, go into Settings and enter your name and email, and tick the "Receive Emails" tickbox
- Select which gamemode you wish to play
- - In Single Player, you must try to get the highest score possible in the allotted time by collecting treasure
- - In Multiplayer you can play against your friends to see who can get the highest score
- - In AI you can observe the AI collecting treasure
